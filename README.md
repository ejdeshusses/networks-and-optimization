FordFulkerson uses NetworkGraph.java to create graph objects with Edge objects. 

MaxFlows.java runs experiments on all graphs from the folders/ files created by GenerateNetworks.ipynb and imported by CopyGraphs.java. 

NetworkMetrics extracts some metrics from max flow networks, but most important data is prinded by MaxFlows.java.
